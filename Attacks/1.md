## Attack: SMB Unknown Login with Possible Bind Shell and VNC Connection
**Devices involved in the attack:**  
**IoT Sensor**  
Port 5900 (VNC)

**Engineering Workstation**  
Port 445 (SMB)  
Port 139 (NetBIOS)

In the SMB shared folder:  
├── Pi_Automation/  
│   ├── Includes scripts and configuration files related to sending temperature and humidity data to MySQL and EdgeX.  
│ It also contains IP addresses, phrases, and text files.  
│  
├── Guidelines_and_Documentation/  
│   ├── Contains PDFs discussing the usage of Raspberry Pis and engineering practices.
│  
├── Configurations/  
│   ├── Holds configuration files for EdgeX IoT Gateway.  

**Detailed Stages of the attack**  
1. Shodan scan reveals open ports (445, 139) on Engineering Workstation.  
2. Nessus scan performed on Engineering Workstation to identify vulnerabilities.
3. Brute-force SMB login grants access to shared folder on Engineering Workstation.
4. Exploration of shared folder reveals scripts, configurations, and sensitive information.
5. Upload of malicious maintenance_script.py onto SMB shared folder.
6. Shell connection established after device owner unknowingly executes malicious script.
7. Internal network reconnaissance identifies another device (IoT Sensor) on the network.
8. Nmap scan reveals open VNC port on IoT sensor device.
9. VNC login allows attacker access to IoT sensor using credentials found in shared folder.
10. Modification of IoT sensor script to send exaggerated data to EdgeX IoT Gateway.

The attack demonstrates a successful breach of the Engineering Workstation, establishment of persistence, internal network reconnaissance, exploitation of another IoT Sensor, and data manipulation, all mapped to relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
